    <p> <em>
      Once upon a time, a family was seeking a baby boy. <br>
      Jeralyn S. Roxas, the mother, wanted to surprise her husband and family with the gender of <br>
      her third child then the baby was born 9 months later.They were expecting a baby boy who would have<br>
      been named "Angelo," but it turned out to be a girl. The mother and father had expected a boy but instead were <br>
      given Tres Marias. That was the time when the beauty appeared. Angela S. Roxas is her name. <br><br><br>

      Angela would be 8 years old when her younger brother is born. Her parents and <br>
      sisters were delighted since she now has a brother, but Angela was sad because she is <br>
      no longer their baby girl. Angela believed she had found a rival for their parents. Angela <br>
      realized months later that she's not the only one who needed their parents' presence.<br>
      Angela is happy to babysit her younger brother. They enjoyed the time they had together.<br><br><br>

      Angela made friends both inside and outside of school. Throughout her elementary <br>
      and high school years, she was indeed a quiet girl. She have made the wrong decisions <br>
      in her life throughout her four years at Sariaya Institute, and she thought that was the end of <br>
      her path, but she is determined to be a good person. She wants a better life and does not wish to return <br>
      to her old routine. She wants to get better and stronger throughout her life in order to live a happy life. <br>
      Angela wants to learn more, do even more than she thinks she capable,and explore the good things in the world.<br><br><br>
